       "Multiple local anesthetics (LAs) can be used for this purpose, but each can come\n",
       "with undesired effects. Lidocaine was used frequently in the past for short\n",
       "surgical procedures due to its shorter duration of action; however, its use has\n",

       "bupivacaine is widely used for SA because of its fast and reliable onset to\n",
       "surgical block.&gt;(r) There have been many studies comparing the efficacy of\n",
       "different LAs for SA in lower extremity and abdominal surgeries with goals of T10\n",
       "and T6 surgical levels respectively. 578 The results prove the utility of\n",

       "spread of the block through epidural analgesia as well as leakage of LA through\n",

As such, it is an important tool in the</br>quest to reduce unintended pregnancy.! Despite its effectiveness, ENG implant users only account for a</br>small proportion of women using LARC methods in the United States.?* Previous studies have</br>demonstrated that among women dissatisfied with their implant, the majority cite unpredictable and</br>irregular bleeding as a primary reason.**&gt;(r) Dissatisfaction with a contraceptive method can lead to</br>discontinuation, which can put a woman at risk for unplanned pregnancy. Although irregular bleeding</br>is a common side effect of all progestin-only contraceptives, there are significant gaps in our knowledge</br>regarding the etiology of and effective therapies for unscheduled bleeding.&quot; While several mechanisms</br>have been proposed and several therapies have been studied, lack of convincing scientific evidence</br>and possible contraindications to these therapies, demonstrate the need to investigate additional</br>effective interventions. This project, through a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial,</br>will evaluate ulipristal acetate (UPA) as a potential therapy for irregular bleeding with the ENG implant.</br>Women will be randomized to receive either 15mg of UPA daily for 7 days or placebo for the same</br>duration.</br></br>OBJECTIVES</br>PRIMARY AIM</br></br>To evaluate the effectiveness of ulipristal acetate (15mg) in decreasing bleeding/spotting days due to</br>the ENG implant over a 30-day period as compared to placebo.</br></br>SECONDARY AIMS (SA)</br></br>SA1: To evaluate bleeding cessation rates by day 10 following seven days of treatment with either</br>ulipristal acetate or placebo.</br></br>SA2: To evaluate participant satisfaction with regards to bleeding pattern after use of ulipristal acetate.</br>SA3: To evaluate participant satisfaction with regards to medication side effects.</br></br>SA4: To evaluate effect, if any, of ulipristal acetate on ovulatory status.</br></br>INTERRUPT: MANUAL OF PROCEDURES</br>page no 3</br>&gt;---PAGEBREAK---&gt;</br>WUSM IRB# 201612002</br>IND# 134150</br></br>KEY PEOPLE AND CONTACT INFORMATION</br></br>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS</br></br>STUDY COORDINATOR</br></br>Rachel Zigler, MD, MTPCI Scholar</br>Washington University in St. Louis</br>School of Medicine</br></br>Division of Clinical Research</br>Department of OB/GYN</br></br>4533 Clayton Avenue</br></br>St. Louis, MO 63110</br></br>(314) 747-6409 phone</br></br>(314) 747-6722 fax</br></br>ziglerr@wustl.edu</br></br>\n",

       "\n",
       "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of rare neoplasms that originate from\n",
       "neuroendocrine cells. According to analysis of the National Cancer Institute Surveillance,\n",
       "Epidemiology and End Results data between 2003 to 2007, the incidence of NET is 3.56 cases\n",
       "per 100,000 (1). Compare this with incidence of colon and rectal cancer at 42.4 cases per\n",
       "100,000. These neoplasms are generally small in size and occur mostly in the gastrointestinal\n",
       "tract and pancreas (so called Gastro-entero-pancreatic NET), but can also occur in other tissues\n",
       "including thymus, lung, and other uncommon sites such as ovaries, heart and ear. These\n",
       "neoplasms can present as multiple primary tumors located in variable sites. Regardless of their\n",
       "primary site, NETs share histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastrucural features. NETs\n",
       "retain multi-potent differentiation capacities including the ability to produce and secrete a variety\n",
       "of metabolically active substances including amines, peptides and prostaglandins following\n",
       "activation from somatostatin, a naturally occuring hormone in the body responsible for controlling\n",
       "neuroendocrine cells. Symptoms of NETs are usually vague, nonspecific and vary by the affected\n",
       "organ. Non-functional NETs are not associated with any specific hormonal syndrome, instead,\n",
       "their clinical manifestations are similar to most solid tumours, i.e. causing mass-effect either\n",
       "inside the organ where the tumor is growing or pressuring adjacent organs and structures (2).\n",
       "\n",
       "The endocrine-related characteristics of NETs arise from the enterochromaffin and\n",
       "enterochromaffin-like cells of the gut. Pancreatic, enteric and unknown origins account for most\n",
       "NETs (&gt;85%). Glucagonomas, VIPomas, and somatostinomas (pancreatic) are the rarest, the\n",
       "combined incidence accounting for only 2% of NETs (2-3).\n",
       "\n",
       "Imaging plays an important role in diagnosing and localization of NETs. The information\n",
       "generated by imaging can guide therapy, which includes medications (somatostatin analogues),\n",
       "chemotherapy and/or surgery (2-3). Surgery remains the first choice for therapy but in many\n",
       "cases, additional therapy is needed as many patients have metastatic disease by the time\n",
       "diagnosis is made.\n",
       "\n",
       "In nuclear medicine, imaging entails localization of a radiopharmaceutical, which is the agent that\n",
       "allows visualization of a normal or abnormal process, on imaging with using detectors. In the case\n",
       "of NETs, because they overexpressed multiple somatostatin receptors on their surfaces, imaging\n",
       "has been performed using a somatostatin analogue. The natural somatostatin has a half-life of 2-\n",
       "3 minutes while a somatostatin analogue consisting of an 8 amino acid protein that represents the\n",
       "part of the naturally occurring somatostatin hormone that localizes to the somatostatin receptor\n",
       "(SSTR) has a half-life of 90 minutes. Thus, it is amenable for imaging. This analogue is attached\n",
       "to a radiopharamaceutical and upon localization to a somatostatin receptor on the surface of a\n",

       "NET; the images obtained allow detection and localization of the NET (3-5). This 8-amino acid\n",
       "analogue is called Octreotide and has been attached to In-111, a gamma emitting\n",
       "radiopharmaceutical through a DTPA linker. The resulting agent is called In-111 Octreotide. In-\n",
       "111 Octreotide is imageable on gamma camera available in many nuclear medicine facilities; this\n",
       "technique is widely known as Octreoscan. It has been approved for use in USA since 1989 (3-6).\n",
       "In-111, the radiopharmaceutical, has a long half-life of 2.8 days. There are advantages to a\n",
       "radiopharmaceutical with such long half-life in that it allows delayed imaging. Currently, imaging is\n",
       "accomplished by acquiring whole body images 4 hours after injection of In-111 Octreotide during\n",
       "which time there is normally no bowel activity and may allow detection of abnormal activity in the\n",
       "abdomen. The patient comes back 24 hours later whereby delayed whole body images and\n",
       "single photon emission tomography (SPECT) is performed. Because of the normal excretion of\n",
       "the agent into the bowel after 4 hours, it is often necessary to repeat the SPECT at 48-72 hours\n",
       "later to confirm that bowel activity moved. The availability of hybrid SPECT/CT has facilitated the\n",
       "distinction of normal bowel activity and abnormal tumor activity in some cases but not in all cases.\n",
       "This imaging procedure often requires multiple trips to the nuclear medicine imaging suite over\n",
       "few days (6).\n",
       "\n",
       "There are important disadvantages as well to a radiopharmaceutical with long half-life. The long\n",
       "half-life involves higher radiation exposure to the patient. To circumvent this, only a very small\n",
       "amount of the radiopharmaceutical can be used often resulting in less than optimal images.\n",
       "Additionally, one can only use a small amount of the somatostatin analogue for the allowable\n",
       "amount of radiopharmaceutical contributing further to poor images. Another factor in poor\n",
       "detection of somatostatin receptors by In-111 Octreotide is the variable sensitivity of this agent to\n",
       "various forms of the receptors. Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) has 5 subtypes: 1-5. In-111-\n",
       "Octreotide has high affinity to SSTR subtype 2 but has no affinity for SSTR 1 and SSTR 4, and\n",
       "low affinity to SSTR 3 and SSTR 5. Thus, the primary tumor is not identified in 20-50% of NETSs.\n",
       "Additional reasons for the relatively high failure rate of detecting NETs include low sensitivity of\n",
       "gamma camera imaging technology so visualization of deep or small lesions can be impaired.\n",
       "Secondly, most somatostatin receptor-positive tumors express multiple SSTR subtypes\n",
       "simultaneously. Thirdly, even in the same patient, the SSTR expression is heterogeneous. Lastly,\n",
       "In-111 Octreotide only has 10 ug of the somatostatin analogue available for receptor localization\n",
       "(6). Thus, In-111 Octreotide may not always successfully demonstrate NETs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Combined positron emission tomography (PET) with CT (PET/CT) technology has proved its\n",
       "utility with F-18 FDG PET/CT imaging of more well-known or more common carcinomas such as\n",
       "lymphoma, breast, colon or lung cancers. The images obtained with a positron emitter using\n",
       "PET/CT technology provides exquisite resolution giving rise to better visualization and more\n",
       "accurate localization of a tumor and allows semiquantitative analysis of a molecular event in a\n",
       "tumor (7). In Europe, investigators found a way to optimize the use of somatostatin analogue by\n",
       "labeling it with a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical, Ga-68, which proved easy to perform.\n",
       "Because of the prior experience with Octreotide, Ga-68 dota-Octreotide was the first agent used\n",
       "(8, 9). This is the same somatostatin analogue in In-111 Octreotide. Ga-68 has a half-life of 68\n",
       "minutes (F-18 FDG, the more common radiopharmaceutical used for many carcinomas, has a\n",
       "half-life of 110 minutes). Following injection, imaging can be performed 60-120 minutes later\n",
       "during which time no bowel activity is seen to confound the evaluation of images. Thus, any\n",
       "tumor within the gut is easily visualized. The shorter half-life decreases the radiation dose to the\n",
       "patient and also allows higher dose of the somatostatin analogue to be incorporated with the\n",
       "radiopharmaceutical: &lt; 50 ug. The shorter half-life of the radiopharmaceutical also means that\n",
       "imaging is completed within 3 hours or less instead of days as in the case of In-111 Octreotide\n",

       "\n",
       "Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most prevalent and burdensome problems for individuals and\n",
       "society in Sweden and worldwide [1,2]. LBP is often defined in terms of its localization, duration,\n",
       "severity, frequency, and interference on activities of daily living [3]. Most new episodes of LBP are\n",
       "self-limiting with only approximately 20% having persistent symptoms but a large majority\n",
       "experience pain recurrence [1]. The aetiology of LBP is often classified as specific or non-specific,\n",
       "based upon if a pathoanatomical cause can be identified through objective diagnostic assessment\n",
       "and confirmed by medical imaging [4]. The prevalence of LBP caused by specific pathology of\n",
       "serious nature such as malignancy, spinal fracture, infection, or cauda equine syndrome requiring\n",
       "secondary or tertiary health care has been reported to range between &lt; 1%-4% in the primary health\n",
       "care setting [5,6]. Furthermore, nerve root problems associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis\n",
       "are thought to explain approximately 5%-15% of cases [7,8]. Medical imaging studies have\n",
       "highlighted that approximately 50% of younger adults and 90% of older adults have degenerative\n",
       "findings and large variations in lumbar spine morphology [9]. This is however evident in both\n",
       "symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals suggesting that low back pain is more typically a result\n",
       "of benign dysfunctional biological and psychological functions as well as social contextual factors\n",
       "influencing the pain experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "In Sweden, the health care process for patients with LBP tends to be fragmented with many health\n",
       "care practitioners (HCP) giving conflicting information and providing interventions of varying\n",
       "effectiveness [10,11]. Our studies have shown that only a third of patients on sick leave for\n",
       "musculoskeletal disorders receive evidence-based rehabilitation interventions in primary care\n",
       "[10,11]. Furthermore our research has also demonstrated that there are still interventions that\n",
       "physiotherapists in primary care consider to be relevant in clinical practice despite the absence of\n",
       "evidence or consensus about the effects [12]. Our preliminary data suggests that when patients with\n",
       "LBP are referred to a specialist clinics, up to 48% have not received adequate evidence-based\n",
       "rehabilitation in primary care. The development of clinical practice guidelines aims to provide HCP\n",
       "with recommendations based on strength of available evidence as well as professional consensus for\n",
       "the intervention's risk and benefits for the patients. Such guidelines are lacking in Sweden but have\n",
       "recently been developed by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority and the English National\n",
       "Institute for Health and Care Excellence [13-15]. These national guidelines provide a thorough\n",
       "assessment of current evidence and can be used in Sweden to form the basis for locally adapted\n",
       "recommendations that are feasible to integrate in local health care setting.\n",
       "\n",
       "Common to LBP, central recommendations from evidence based clinical guidelines for arthritis are\n",
       "also education and exercise therapy aimed at improving patient self-care. These principles have\n",
       "been packaged in well-known models of care describing how complex patient interventions can be\n",

       "weight, yet individual weight change ranged from a 22% weight loss to a 4% weight gain\n",
       "[3]. Physiologically, differences in energy metabolism likely explain much of this\n",

       "resistant to traditional weight loss strategies is a 'key challenge' of obesity researchers\n",

       "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a disorder of development of movement and posture due to non-\n",
       "progressive lesion in fetal or infant brain. Postural control in children with cerebral palsy (CP)\n",
       "is deteriorated due to inappropriate muscle force and lack of sensory integration. The trunk\n",
       "which is found in the centre of the body plays a crucial role in postural control. Research and\n",
       "treatments in CP have focused on extremities rather than trunk control. Both evaluation and\n",
       "treatment of trunk impairment have not been adequately addressed in previously published\n",
       "studies. Improved proximal stability obtained by a better trunk control may lead to\n",
       "\n",
       "improvements in upper extremity function.\n",
       "\n",
       "Dynamic elastomeric fabric orthosis (DEFO) which are lycra based compression garments\n",
       "provide extra proprioceptive information which enhances body awareness. The more correct\n",
       "proprioceptive input result in the more proper alignment. Vest type dynamic elastomeric\n",

       "The affected palmar fascia gradually forms thick cords\n",
       "which cause flexion contracture in one or more fingers.\n",
       "The contracture most often develops in the metacarpo-\n",

       "There is no definitive cure for the pathological process\n",
       "in DC. The treatment aims at relieving the contracture by\n",
       "cutting or excising the cords, limiting the range of motion\n",
       "(ROM) of the fingers. The options can be divided into two\n",
       "categories: (1) open surgical excision and (2) percuta-\n",
       "neous division of the cords using a needle or collagenase\n",

       "gained more popularity lately.&quot; In an outpatient clinic,\n",
       "collagenase is injected inside the cord, which is ruptured\n",

       "\n",
       "Economic theory predicts that increases in life expectancy should lead to more\n",
       "forward-looking behavior [1]. Individuals who face a higher probability of living to\n",
       "future periods are expected to invest more resources in education and job training\n",
       "today, in order to enjoy greater total consumption over their lifetime. Similarly, with\n",
       "greater longevity, individuals are less likely to take risks - e.g. drunk driving,\n",
       "smoking, or sex work - that jeopardize their enjoyment of future utility. In spite of\n",
       "its theoretical appeal, the evidence on a causal link between subjective life\n",
       "expectancy and economic behavior is limited [2-4], particularly related to young\n",
       "adults and HIV. Perhaps the strongest evidence comes from a study in rural Malawi\n",
       "which found that scale-up of antiretroviral therapy led to increased survival\n",
       "expectations, greater labor supply, and greater human capital investment and\n",
       "savings [5,6]. However, without randomization of ART scale-up it is possible that\n",
       "other factors could have confounded this relationship.\n",
       "\n",
       "Antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV has dramatically reduced mortality due to\n",
       "HIV/AIDS, turning what was once a death sentence into a manageable chronic\n",
       "condition. In rural KwaZulu-Natal, roll out of ART in the public sector has led to\n",
       "large gains in adult life expectancy, with gains of 18 years since 2003 (update of Bor,\n",

       "live in a household or compound with someone who has sought care in the\n",

       "young adults think about their future. Little is known, however, about young adults'\n",
       "health perceptions in the age of ART and how perceptions affect health behaviors\n",
       "and feedback to the HIV epidemic itself. This increase in life expectancy may raise\n",
       "incentives for young adults to engage in preventive health behaviors - e.g,, testing\n",
       "and linkage to HIV care - and future oriented behaviors like schooling and savings.\n",
       "However, limited information about these survival changes and bandwidth\n",

       "benefits to preventive health behaviors.\n",
       "\n",
       "Formative qualitative research conducted in advance of this intervention study (and\n",
       "data from elsewhere [10]) revealed that many young adults have survival\n",
       "expectations substantially below the life expectancy implied by prevailing mortality\n",
       "rates in the population. Our qualitative data also showed that young adults who\n",
       "were pessimistic about their survival chances were often fatalistic about investing in\n",
       "their future. These beliefs may be self-fulfilling, such that fatalism about the future\n",
       "leads to riskier health behaviors and diminished opportunities later in life,\n",
       "generating a behavioral poverty trap [11]. Low survival expectations and associated\n",
       "fatalism may also reduce a young adult's likelihood of HIV testing and early ART\n",

       "HIV prevalence in this population is very high, with one third of adults HIV-infected.\n",
       "The availability of ART in the public sector, beginning in 2004, led to a major shift in\n",
       "the health risk environment. Based on data from AHRI's complete population\n",
       "surveillance of births, deaths, and migrations, we previously computed an increase\n",
       "in population adult life expectancy of 11.3 years between 2003 and 2011 [7]; by\n",

You may choose not to be in this study and get other treatments</br>without changing your healthcare, services or other rights. You can stop being in this study at any time. If we</br>learn something new that may affect the risks or benefits of this study, you will be told so that you can decide</br>whether or not you still want to be in this study. Your medical record will contain a note saying you are in a</br>research study. Anyone you authorize to receive your medical record will also get this note.</br></br>1. What is the purpose of this study?</br></br>You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are a current smoker interested in</br>taking medication to help you quit smoking. This study will help the researchers understand more about</br>how to help people quit smoking. Some people break down nicotine in their body more quickly than</br>others and certain medications might be more effective for helping a person quit smoking depending on</br>how fast their body breaks down nicotine. This study is trying to determine if a blood test that measures</br>how a person's body breaks down nicotine can help doctors choose the medication that is most effective</br>in helping that person quit smoking.</br></br>2. What will happen and how long will you be in the study?</br></br>Taking part in this study is voluntary. If you decide to be in this study, you will be asked to read, sign, and</br>date this informed consent. A copy of this form will be given to you for your records. You will be asked to</br>complete a questionnaire about your opinions on smoking treatment and how providers choose the best</br>medications to help patients quit smoking. Additionally, you will be asked a brief medical assessment to</br>help us understand how you are currently feeling. The questionnaire will take approximately 30 minutes</br>to complete.</br></br>You will be assigned to either a guideline-based care group (&quot;Study Group 1&quot;) or a personalized care</br>group (&quot;Study Group 2&quot;). If you are in the guideline-based care group, you will receive information</br>regarding smoking medications, and then choose a medication based on that information and your</br>personal preferences. If you are in the personalized care group, you will receive information regarding</br>smoking medications as well as results from a blood test that measures how your body breaks down</br>nicotine. You will then choose a medication based on that information and your personal preferences.</br></br>Regardless of which group you are assigned, you will be asked to provide a blood sample that will allow</br>the research team to measure how quickly your body breaks down nicotine. Your body breaks down</br>nicotine in your liver into other substances. This test measures how quickly your body changes nicotine</br>into these substances. The result of this test is called the nicotine metabolite ratio.

These may have value and may be developed</br>and owned by the study staff, Vanderbilt University, and/or others. If this happens, there are no plans to</br>provide money to you.</br></br>About one week (but within 1 month) after consenting to the study, the research staff will call you at</br>home to discuss medications to help you quit smoking. If you choose to receive medications, a</br>prescription will be called to an outpatient pharmacy where you may pick it up. You will be asked to take</br>this medication as prescribed. You may be prescribed one or more of the following FDA-approved</br>tobacco cessation medications:</br></br>Nicotine Replacement Therapy (patch)</br>Varenicline (also called Chantix)</br>Bupropion (also called Wellbutrin or Zyban)</br></br>To learn about potential risks and side effects of these medications, please see Section 4 of this</br>document.</br></br>During your study participation, you will receive phone calls from the research team approximately 1, 3,</br>and 6 months after your initial phone call. You may be asked about your smoking behaviors and how the</br>medication you are taking makes you feel. These phone calls will last no longer than 30 minutes.</br>Approximately 1 month after the initial phone call (made by clinical staff concerning your medication) you</br>may be asked to attend an in-person follow-up visit at Vanderbilt Medical Center with the research team</br>and provide a blood sample to determine the amount of quit smoking medication in your body and</br>complete an in person questionnaire (rather than by phone). This blood sample may be shipped to other</br>investigators to where the test is performed.</br></br>Approximately 6 months after the initial phone, if you have not smoked for 7 or more days, you will be</br>asked to attend an in-person follow-up visit at Vanderbilt Medical Center with the research team. The</br>research team will call you to schedule this visit. At this visit, you will complete a brief questionnaire</br>about your opinions on smoking treatment. This questionnaire will take approximately 30 minutes to</br>complete. Lastly, you will be asked to take an optional breath test that measures the amount of carbon</br>monoxide in your lungs. Completion of this breath test requires you to hold a small device and breathe</br>into a mouthpiece. In total, the follow-up visit will take approximately 45 minutes.</br></br> </br></br>Approximately 6 months after the initial phone call, if you are still smoking, you will be asked to complete</br>a brief questionnaire by phone.

Costs to you if you take part in this study:</br></br>If you agree to take part in this research study, you and/or your insurance will not have to pay for the</br>tests that are part of the study, such as the blood test, breath test, and saliva test.</br></br>You will not have to pay for the cost of medications to quit smoking that are offered at the beginning of</br>the study. However, those participants in Study Group 1 who are still smoking and wish to have a</br>prescription called in at the end of the study, will be responsible of the cost of those medications if they</br>chose to have the prescription filled.</br></br>You will also be responsible for paying any costs associated with transportation to Vanderbilt University</br>Medical Center for follow-up.</br></br>You have the right to ask what it may cost you to take part in this study. If you would like assistance,</br>financial counseling is available through the Vanderbilt Financial Assistance Program. The study staff</br>can help you contact this program. You have the right to contact your insurance company to discuss the</br>costs of your routine care (non-research) further before choosing to be in the study. You may choose not</br>to be in this study if your insurance does not pay for your routine care (non-research) costs and your</br>doctor will discuss other treatment plans with you.</br></br>4. Side effects and risks that you can expect if you take part in this study:</br></br>Blood draw: You are being asked to have your blood drawn. This is a common medical procedure, but</br>has some associated risks. Pain, redness, soreness, bruising, or infection may occur at the needle stick</br>site. Rarely, some patients faint.</br></br>Medications: You may be prescribed one or more of the following FDA-approved tobacco cessation</br>medications. Some of the common side effects of each medication are described below. However, a</br>large study of over 8,000 patients recently showed no difference in neuropsychiatric symptoms (including</br>suicidal thought and suicidal behavior) between patients on varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine</br>replacement therapy (EAGLES; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01456936).</br></br>Nicotine Replacement Therapy</br>o Nicotine replacement therapy is generally regarded as safe.

       "prostate cancer who have anxiety associated with their diagnosis, to implement a 12-week\n",
       "licensed psychologist-facilitated group intervention in this patient population to determine if\n",
       "treating disease-related anxiety improves quality of life, delays radical, elective treatment of\n",
       "prostate cancer, and to monitor symptom progression and remission during and after therapy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our goal is to further our understanding of anxiety in men who are diagnosed with prostate\n",
       "cancer, and to determine if effectively treating disease-related anxiety can improve patients'\n",
       "quality of life, delay radical, elective treatment, and potentially improve disease progression.\n",
       "\n",
       "I BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n",
       "\n",
       "Previous research suggests that the prevalence of anxiety in prostate cancer (PCa) patients\n",
       "undergoing active surveillance (AS) may be two to three times greater than anxiety levels of\n",
       "similarly aged men in the general population who have not been diagnosed with prostate\n",
       "cancer'. There is concern that substantial feelings of anxiety in men undergoing AS may be\n",
       "enough to divert PCa patients from AS to pursue definitive treatment(r).\n",
       "\n",
       "To date, there is no consensus with regard to the optimal active surveillance protocol. Most\n",
       "active surveillance regimens consist of regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests, digital\n",
       "rectal exams (DREs), and serial biopsies to assess for signs of progression.\n",
       "\n",
       "Although numerous studies have assessed the psychological impact active surveillance may\n",
       "have on men, no study has examined the role that a holistic regimen may have on these men's\n",
       "health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of this study is to determine the extent to which\n",
       "disease-related anxiety in patients undergoing our institution's AS protocol may alter their\n",
       "course of treatment. It is possible that the psychosocial concern of living with cancer may have\n",
       "adverse effects on PCa patients, and the anxiety related to living with cancer may be enough to\n",
       "divert PCa patients from participating in AS to pursue definitive treatment?. Previously, it has\n",
       "page no 1\n",
       "&gt;---PAGEBREAK---&gt;\n",
       "been demonstrated that, at the moment of treatment choice, fear of disease progression is the\n",
       "main reason patients reject AS for a more radical treatment approach(r).\n",
       "\n",
       "Clinical studies have investigated the claim that men who choose AS as a treatment option may\n",
       "be at higher risk of psychological distress than men who choose a more radical approach'.\n",
       "Patients with PCa undergoing AS experienced substantially higher rates of depression and\n",
       "anxiety, when compared to a control population'. This may be due in part to the passive nature\n",
       "of AS, but studies have also shown that the adverse side effects of PCa may also contribute to\n",
       "an increase in anxiety and depression levels for men undergoing AS&quot;.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some data suggest PCa patients undergoing AS may benefit from psychological interventions\n",
       "such as behavioral therapy, group therapy, or mindfulness-based stress reduction(r). In one\n",
       "study, AS PCa patients who participated in a mindfulness training program for 8-weeks\n",
       "demonstrated significant decrease in PCa-related anxiety. These patients also reported\n",
       "significant increases in global mental health, posttraumatic growth, and mindfulness(r). Other\n",
       "studies have yielded similar results, demonstrating that educating patients about PCa and how\n",
       "to manage the adverse side effects through cognitive-behavioral interventions may also reduce\n",
       "disease-related anxiety in patients undergoing ASdeg.\n",
       "\n",
       "Il STUDY DESIGN\n",
       "\n",
       "Patients who are diagnosed with PCa will be given the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate\n",
       "Cancer (MAX-PC) which is a highly internally consistent, and concurrently and discriminately\n",
       "valid questionnaire used to identify levels of anxiety related to prostate cancer(r)' as well as the\n",
       "Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, which is a valid, reliable, and efficient 7 item\n",
       "scale used to identify patients with generalized anxiety disorder and has also been effectively\n",
       "used in a population of men with prostate cancer(r)(r).\n",
       "\n",
       "Those PCa patients who have elected AS, obtain a score of 216 on the MAX-PC, and who meet\n",
       "other inclusion criteria, will be randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. Patients\n",
       "assigned to the treatment group will receive 12 weekly 1-hour sessions of structured group\n",
       "therapy intervention led by a licensed psychologist, in addition to AS educational material.\n",
       "Patients assigned to the control group will receive the standard AS educational material only.\n",
       "The research coordinator, who will be responsible for disseminating the educational material\n",
       "and answering patient questions regarding AS, will be blinded to the randomization outcome the\n",
       "the study subjects.\n",
       "\n",
       "Patients in both the treatment group and control group will be monitored using MAX-PC, GAD-7,\n",
       "and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaires at various\n",
       "time points, as described below. We hypothesize that those patients who undergo group\n",
       "therapy will have a significant reduction in their disease-related anxiety, as reflected by a\n",
       "reduction in their MAX-PC score by the end of their 12-week group therapy intervention.\n",
       "Furthermore, we expect to see an improvement in their quality of life, as measured by the\n",
       "scores obtained on the FACT-P. In addition, results of the program intervention will be\n",
       "correlated with PSA level changes.\n",

       "1) Session one (1 hour) -- Dr. Isaki or a research assistant will review the informed consent form\n",
       "with you, answer any of your questions, and if you would like to participate in the study, you\n",
       "will be asked to sign the informed consent form. Next, Dr. Isaki or a research assistant will ask\n",

       "gender, date of injury, ethnicity, address, years of education, occupation, phone number, and\n",
       "email address) and identification of symptoms related to concussion/mTBI, and then complete\n",
       "five short screening measures related to cognitive-communication. Finally, you will review an\n",
       "education sheet of symptoms and expectations for recovery following concussion/mTBI, and\n",
       "schedule an appointment for the second screening session.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) Session two (1 hour) -- Dr. Isaki or a research assistant will ask you to complete five short\n",
       "screening measures related to cognitive-communication. If the screening measures note any\n",
       "problems after the second session, Dr. Isaki or a research assistant will contact you to schedule\n",
       "therapy one time a week for one month. If you require therapy, you will be randomly assigned\n",
       "to one of two groups. Group one will receive therapy one month following injury, and Group\n",
       "two will receive therapy two months following injury. Random assignment means that you\n",

       "Computer-based Training for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT4CBT) is a new on-\n",
       "line addiction treatment developed by Dr Kathleen Carroll at the Yale School of Medicine in\n",
       "New Haven, Connecticut. CBT4CBT consists of seven one-hour long online sessions that teach\n",
       "key concepts, including dealing with cravings, problem solving, and decision making skills, to\n",
       "help users reduce substance abuse. CBT4CBT has been rigorously tested throughout various\n",
       "communities in the United States with great success and is currently being rolled out throughout\n",

       "\n",
       "the States. The therapeutic approach of CBT4CBT is unique as its efficacy, durability and cost-\n",
       "savings have been proven in several rigorous clinical trials and will be magnified by the fact that\n",
       "the program can be delivered in Canada, allowing for increased and continual improvements in\n",
       "population health. CBT4CBT has been accepted by both patients and addiction treatment\n",
       "personnel alike and has won numerous clinical innovation awards.\n",
       "\n",
       "A collaboration has now been formed between Dr Carroll and Drs Michelle Patterson and\n",
       "Juergen Krause of the UPEI Centre for Health and Community Research (CHCR) that will bring\n",
       "CBT4CBT to Canada. While CBT4CBT has previously been tested in urban areas, there are\n",
       "many advantages to offering computer-based training to more rural populations (such as PEI).\n",
       "These more remote areas frequently suffer from a lack of services, as well as a lack of continuity\n",
       "with the services currently offered. CBT4CBT may very well provide that needed continuity to\n",
       "Addictions treatment and has also been shown to improve retention.\n",

       "3. BACKGROUND, RATIONALE AND STATEMENT OF RESEARCH\n",
       "QUESTION(S):\n",
       "\n",
       "CBT4CBT will be the first computer-based, cognitive behavioural therapy program for\n",
       "Addictions treatment to be offered in Canada. CBT4CBT has been rigorously tested in urban\n",
       "populations in the United States but this collaboration will be the first pilot trial in First Nation\n",
       "and other rural communities in Canada. Prince Edward Island has a self-proclaimed need for\n",
       "innovative new substance abuse treatments and CBT4CBT may provide the continuity and\n",
       "retention to traditional therapy programs that current available treatment options often lack. This\n",
       "study will allow CBT4CBT to be tested in several Prince Edward Island communities to gage its\n",
       "efficacy and effectiveness. The results and feedback received from the pilot study will allow the\n",
       "program to be adapted for Canadian populations in order to optimize its positive outcomes within\n",
       "Canada.\n",
       "\n",
       "CBT4CBT has been tested in urban populations in the United States in three rigorous\n",
       "randomized clinical trials with great success. The nature of CBT4CBT suggests it would also be\n",
       "beneficial in rural and remote populations which are common across Canada. Computer based\n",
       "treatments are cost-effective and although their nature necessitates human participants they have\n",
       "minimal risk associated with them. As the first computer based training for Addictions in\n",
       "Canada this research project could have broad implications for treatment in Addictions across\n",
       "our country.\n",
       "\n",
       "Analysis techniques will be based on those used in previous CBT4CBT trials conducted by our\n",
       "collaborator, Dr Carroll.\n",
       "\n",
       "The primary substance abuse outcomes (self-reported abstinence) will be assessed throughout the\n",
       "study and through a six month follow-up. Additional outcomes will include use of other services\n",
       "(medical, legal), patient and provider satisfaction, as well as the costs of implementing the\n",
       "program. Each week, the counsellors will deliver a questionnaire (provided by the CHCR) which\n",
       "covers this range of topics to their patient participating in the trial. The data will be analyzed\n",
       "with a focus on feasibility (retention in both conditions, levels of substance abuse, health\n",
       "problems, and cost by condition).\n",

       "\n",
       "Participants randomized to the test group will receive treatment as usual but will also be asked to\n",
       "spend at least thirty minutes per week using the program. CBT4CBT use by each participant will\n",
       "be monitored throughout the trial to ensure that this requirement is being met. They may choose\n",

       "\n",
       "Sport-related concussion is a common injury that results in more than 200,000\n",
       "emergency department visits annually, 65% of which are children aged 5 to 18.&quot; Recognized\n",
       "as a major public health concern,? sport-related concussion diagnoses in the United States\n",
       "have increased by 43% overall over the last 5 years.? Rates of increase over the same time\n",
       "span were also found to be higher for pediatric (71%) and female (up to 118%) populations,\n",
       "consistent with research indicating that the incidence and clinical outcomes of concussion\n",
       "vary with sex and age*; specifically, significantly higher risks and poorer outcomes have been\n",
       "reported for younger and female populations.'&gt;*(r) Because the developing brains of children\n",

       "\n",
       "Low neck strength is a risk factor thought to contribute to an elevated concussion risk.*!?\n",
       "Previous studies have shown that athletes with smaller and weaker necks experience greater\n",
       "resultant linear and angular head displacements, velocities, and accelerations after\n",
       "impact.2%!314 Because these parameters represent the primary mechanisms contributing to a\n",
       "concussive event, further studies clarifying the relationships between neck strength and the\n",
       "risk and clinical outcomes of concussion are warranted. To date, only 1 study has examined\n",
       "the relationship between neck strength and concussion incidence; in a prospective study of\n",
       "high school athletes, Collins et al'&gt; measured isometric neck strength parameters using a\n",
       "hand-held tension scale and monitored the concussion rate over several sports sessions. Neck\n",
       "strength was found to be a significant predictor of concussion incidence among high school\n",
       "students, with concussed athletes demonstrating 11% to 22% reduction in neck strength\n",
       "compared with nonconcussed athletes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the increases in the reported incidence of head injuries sustained by young student\n",
       "athletes in the United States, it is essential that high school and university athletics programs\n",
       "have access to inexpensive, effective, and easy-to-implement strategies for the prevention of\n",
       "concussions. Collectively, the results of previous studies suggest that interventions aimed at\n",
       "increasing athletes' neck strength may be effective for decreasing the risk and symptoms of\n",

       "You are invited to take part in this study because you are a non-obese person of Chinese or\n",
       "Indian descent, between 21 and 65 years old. During screening, we will briefly evaluate your\n",
       "metabolic health by measuring the levels of glucose (sugar) and insulin (a hormone) in your\n",

       "approaches to improve metabolic health. A relatively large fraction of the Singaporean\n",

Title: Novel PAradigm to improve Inflammatory burden in ESRD (rePAIR): A pilot and feasibility Randomized</br>Controlled Trial</br>page no 3</br>&gt;---PAGEBREAK---&gt;</br>IRB Review</br>IRB NUMBER: 16-111-1</br>Version 10; May 07, 2018 IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/07/2018</br></br>2, Background</br></br>Why is the project being proposed?: Given the importance of inflammation as a predictor of</br>cardiovascular mortality in ESRD?&quot; 24, reductions in biochemical inflammatory markers have been</br>proposed as critical target outcomes in this population?. Several anti-inflammatory strategies have been</br>utilized in this direction assessing nutritional?deg(r) as well as pharmacological interventions?3 2728, Although</br>the results of these trials hold promise, many investigators recognized different sources of inflammation</br>in these patients, which need to be resolved in order to achieve the most optimal responses(r)- 29. As</br>expected, the inflammatory modulation requires concurrent therapy of the multiple comorbidities,</br>which characterize this population3(r) 3! 32, The present multidisciplinary proposal is significant because</br>it promises to:</br></br>1. Reduce inflammatory burden in ESRD through systematic and ongoing oral health and</br>behavioral interventions treating oral infections within dialysis units.</br></br>2. Improve access to care and quality of life in ESRD as measured by validated surveys and</br>biomarkers.</br></br>3. Facilitate care quality improvement and management of ESRD patients as well as expand</br>performance of dialysis units.</br></br>This proposal focuses on targeting chronic periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of biofilm</br>etiology, which causes connective tissue and bone destruction and, consequently, leads to tooth loss? 33.</br>Chronic periodontitis is associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis, adverse pregnancy outcomes,</br>rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and aspiration pneumonias4 35 36-38,</br>Although recent epidemiological evidence showed a severe periodontitis prevalence of ~8.5% in the</br>general US population?, this prevalence increased up to ~40% in some racial groups with CKD3 49 5, The</br>PI has extensively worked on oral health in CKD within the scope of her NTH/NIDCR K23 Mentored</br>Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23DE018689), which has successfully</br>achieved 4 major goals: 1) to assess the prevalence of periodontal infections in CKD, 2) to examine the</br>impact of periodontitis on the systemic inflammatory status of CKD patients following oral interventions</br>and 3) to produce pilot data on inflammation and oxidative stress and 4) to develop multidisciplinary</br>partnerships securing strong recruitment strategies and effective regulatory processes.</br></br>Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III database, we</br>demonstrated significantly higher periodontitis prevalence accentuated by racial disparities in CKD</br>(Table 1)5, which exceeds 50% in ESRD(r) 39-42, Despite periodontitis recognition as a critical public health</br>problem (Healthy People 2020), disease awareness in CKD/ESRD populations is low43. Therefore, oral</br>health promotion as well as effective treatment and prevention with focus on improving systemic</br>inflammation and oxidative stress should become a priority in these populations.</br></br> </br></br> </br></br> </br></br> </br></br>Non-Hispanic Whites Non-Hispanic Blacks Mexican-Americans</br>CKD Non-CKD CKD Non-CKD CKD Non-CKD</br>N =437 N =4216 p-Value N =88 N =3182 p-Value N =81 N = 3600 p-Value</br>Periodontits ~ 12.9 (1.8 7.5 (0.4) 0001  38.9(58  14.6 (0.5 0.001  37.3(6.8) 9.0 (0.5) 0.001</br></br>Table 1: Periodontitis prevalence as stratified by race in CKD and non-CKD population (n=11,604).

It</br>is considered as minimally invasive procedure with numerous advantages compared with</br>open surgery including less postoperative pain, faster recovery, shorter length of hospital</br></br>stay and less overall medical cost&quot;</br></br>. The creation of pneumoperitoneum (PP) during</br>laparoscopic surgery, however, can have significant effects on the respiratory system.</br>The rise in intraabdominal pressure (IAP) causes cephalic displacement and stiffness of</br>the diaphragm resulting in a decrease in the compliance of the respiratory system (Cgs)</br>and of the chest wall (Ccw) (tm) as well as an increase in pleural pressure (Pp) likely due to</br>thoracoabdominal transmission of IAP. Combine with a decrease in respiratory muscle</br>tone following general anesthesia(r)), the vital capacity and the functional residual capacity</br>(FRC) are declined(r). There also atelectasis formation resulted from airway closure</br>(compressive atelectasis) and absorption of gas trapped distal to occluded airways</br>(absorption atelectasis)(r). All of these changes potentially lead to an increase in dead</br>space ventilation as well as shunt and subsequently impair oxygenation&quot;. This</br>pathophysiology may put patients at risk of postoperative pulmonary complications</br>(PPCs) such as respiratory infection, respiratory failure, reintubation or prolonged</br>mechanical ventilation and possibly increase mortality!&quot; Y=,</br></br>Therefore, intraoperative mechanical ventilation has an important role in respiratory</br></br>management during laparoscopic surgery'&quot;. Setting of positive end-expiratory pressure</br>page no 2</br>&gt;---PAGEBREAK---&gt;</br>(PEEP) has been shown to attenuate the derangement of respiratory mechanics and the</br>impairment in oxygenation caused by PP&quot;'_ In addition, the application of PEEP as a</br>part of intraoperative protective mechanical ventilation may be associated with a decrease</br>in PPCs following laparoscopic surgery'(r). Nevertheless, there is no consensus on the</br>optimal PEEP level and the best method to set PEEP during laparoscopic surgery(g). In</br>patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Talmor et al'&quot; demonstrated</br>that mechanical ventilation with PEEP set according to P,; measured by using esophageal</br>balloon catheter significantly had beneficial effects in terms of oxygenation, Crs and</br>possible mortality. With PEEP set according to this method, the transpulmonary pressure</br>(Ptp), which is the difference between the pressure inside alveoli or PEEP and the</br>pressure outside or Py, is constantly maintained positive during expiration. Consequently,</br>it helps to prevent the formation of atelectasis as well as to recruit the collapsed alveoli</br>and, thus, to improve oxygenation. To date, there is limited data regarding the use of</br>esophageal balloon catheter to set PEEP in mechanically ventilated patients undergoing</br>laparoscopic surgery. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether PEEP</br>titration guided by P, measurement during laparoscopic surgery would improve</br>pulmonary function in term of oxygenation as well as other parameters such as</br></br>compliance and alveolar dead space.</br>page no 3</br>&gt;---PAGEBREAK---&gt;</br>2 WANGLANG Rd.

       "produce data which will be analyzed by Therma-Scan Reference Laboratory. Dr. Hoekstra, CEO of\n",
       "Therma-Scan, is the author of a published paper based on breast thermal data with a reported 95%\n",
       "sensitivity and 91% specificity(r). The SBSII examination will take approximately 7 minutes.\n",

       "This study is designed to evaluate the Sentinel Breast Scan II(r) as well as the analysis of data by\n",
       "Therma-Scan. SBSII(r) thermal breast data is an adjunctive aid to standard breast imaging. Currently,\n",
       "mammography is one of the standards of care in screening for visible signs of breast cancer. Breast\n",
       "thermology is the analysis of the heat signature data from an examined breast. All study costs will be\n",
       "incurred by the sponsor. Study subjects will incur no cost to participate. All scientific data revealed in\n",

       "\n",
       "Screening is testing of asymptomatic (without symptoms) and symptomatic women.\n",
       "Mammograms identify abnormalities and determine their location in the breast. If a biopsy of the area in\n",

       "annual clinical breast exam and mammogram for women over 40 years of age? . Women with a family\n",
       "history of Breast Cancer or other indicators may be screened at an earlier age and more frequently. If the\n",
       "results are positive, further diagnostic testing may be prescribed and a biopsy may be taken. If the SBSII\n",
       "scan reveals a thermal pattern on analysis that meets established criteria and the mammogram is read as\n",
       "normal, FSM intends to contact the site PI. The study participant will then be encouraged to undergo\n",
       "additional standard diagnostic imaging tests. These additional tests are performed to assure that the\n",
       "patient has no evidence of abnormality utilizing advanced breast imaging techniques in use today.\n",
       "However, the additional tests ordered may indicate the need for further investigation prescribed by the\n",

       "BACKGROUND\n",
       "\n",
       "Among people living with HIV, challenges related to brain health are emerging. Brain health is\n",
       "a broad term referring to the inter-related factors of cognition, mood, anxiety, motivation,\n",
       "fatigue, stress and coping [1]. For example, among people with HIV, the severity of depressive\n",
       "symptoms has repeatedly been associated with the presence of self-reported cognitive\n",
       "difficulties, even in the absence of impairment on neuropsychological testing [2, 3]. There is\n",
       "uncertainty about the clinical importance of these self-reports, especially when\n",
       "neuropsychological testing is normal, as they are thought to be susceptible to patients' biases and\n",
       "\n",
       "insights into their illness.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, there is growing evidence that these self-reports are clinically important. Among\n",
       "patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), evidence suggests that functional impairments\n",
       "is mediated by self-reported cognitive dysfunction, rather than objective cognitive dysfunction\n",
       "[4]. For example, Buist-Bouwman et al reported that more than one-quarter of the impact of\n",
       "MDD on work loss was directly attributable to self-reported cognitive difficulties and that\n",
       "cognition was a significant mediator of the association between MDD and work or role\n",
       "\n",
       "dysfunction [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "When depression is treated with antidepressant medication, some degree of improvement on\n",
       "neuropsychological tests has been documented [6, 7] . However, many studies have evaluated\n",
       "cognitive outcomes before and after treatment rather than comparing them with placebo,\n",
       "potentially biasing the results by learning effects, which limits the strength of the conclusions\n",
       "that can be drawn.\n",
       "\n",
       "Treatment of depression with Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy (CBT) has been shown to improve\n",
       "depressive symptoms and psychosocial functioning in patients with recurrent major depressive\n",
       "disorder [8], but there are few studies of the impact of psychotherapy on self-reported cognition\n",
       "and cognitive performance. In a group of patients with highly recurrent depression (&gt;4 episodes)\n",
       "over 2 years of follow-up, Conradi et al showed that those randomized to receive psycho-\n",
       "education plus CBT reported the presence of cognitive symptoms significantly less of the time\n",
       "compared to those receiving psycho-education only (15% of the time or 3.6 months compared to\n",
       "\n",
       "47% or 11.3 months) [9].\n",

       "\n",
       "Oxygenation -- the process of delivering oxygen to the lungs -- is often\n",
       "much simpler to achieve than ventilation, since only a small volume of\n",
       "oxygen must be delivered to oxygenate the patient and provide a\n",
       "reserve. Carbon dioxide, however, constantly accumulates and depends\n",
       "on ongoing ventilation to eliminate it from the lungs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Direct automatic ventilation monitors tend to be cumbersome. They\n",
       "typically require chest straps or EKG-type stickers to be placed on the\n",
       "patient's chest. EKG signals themselves can be used to detect inhalation\n",
       "and exhalation, but the noise of EKG monitors tends to make this\n",
       "method unreliable. In most cases, the patient needs to be lying quite still\n",
       "in order for accurate ventilation monitoring and even then they measure\n",
       "respiratory rate and not tidal volume.\n",
       "\n",
       "The gold standard method to measure the adequacy of ventilation is to\n",
       "measure the exhaled carbon dioxide concentration. Exhaled gas almost\n",
       "always contains carbon dioxide that may be measured using either\n",
       "sidestream or mainstream capnography. However, the carbon dioxide\n",
       "tension is only a surrogate measure of ventilation since it is the changes\n",
       "in tidal volume per breath or minute ventilation that determines the\n",
       "adequacy of respiration and therefore the carbon dioxide tension.\n",
       "Capnography accurately measures the respiratory rate and the net effect\n",
       "of ventilation without reporting the tidal volume. Knowing the tidal\n",

       "Cytotoxic agents, such as fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin, are considered narrow therapeutic\n",
       "index drugs, where small changes in drug exposure can greatly impact clinical efficacy and\n",
       "toxicity. 5-FU is hydrophilic, but widely distributed through active transport(tm). It undergoes\n",
       "extensive metabolism, primarily through dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), variants of\n",
       "which have been associated with increased risk of toxicity to 5-FU'. On the basis of these\n",
       "considerations, 5-FU clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) are likely related to body\n",
       "composition. Gusella et al. studied the PK of adjuvant 5-FU (425 mg/m? IV bolus) in 34\n",
       "colorectal cancer patients(tm) and determined that CL was significantly correlated with sex and fat\n",
       "free mass (FFM), while V was correlated with sex and Total Body Water (TBW). Overall, they\n",
       "concluded that CL of 5-FU was better predicted by FFM and TBW than by Body Surface Area\n",
       "(BSA)(tm). Thus, clearance of 5-FU is expected to increase (i.e. exposure decrease) in individuals\n",
       "with a higher FFM.\n",
       "\n",
       "Body composition is also known to impact the PK of oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin is eliminated renally,\n",
       "with clearance similar to glomerular filtration rate'(r). Quinney et al.&quot;(r) have previously reported\n",
       "that obesity is associated with an increased GFR as measured by clearance of iohexol. Thus, it\n",
       "is expected that oxaliplatin clearance may be increased in individuals with more adiposity and\n",
       "because it is also highly lipophilic, may lead to increased distribution in individuals with higher\n",
       "FM/MM ratios. In a population PK analysis of ultrafilterable oxaliplatin in 56 adults with\n",
       "metastatic disease, both CL and V were associated with bodyweight and individuals with higher\n",

       "\n",
       "The European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) recently developed its 2020 vision, and it\n",

       "radical radiation therapy when used as a single curative modality of treatment or when used in\n",

       "HNCa. Around a half of survivors underwent radiotherapy as part of their curative care.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet, many patients receiving potentially curative radiotherapy will experience toxicity due to the\n",
       "unavoidable irradiation of surrounding healthy tissue. The toxicity varies in severity from minor to severe\n",
       "and in duration from weeks to a lifetime. Around 7-10% of people suffer with severe long-term side-effects\n",

(MICRO-</br>LEARNER)</br></br>Dear Patient,</br></br>You are invited to take part in a research study. We would like to explain to you why the research is being</br>done and what it will involve for you. Please take time to read the following information carefully and</br>discuss it with others if you wish. Please ask us if anything is not clear or if you need more information.</br>Take time to decide if you wish to take part.</br></br>What is the purpose of this study?</br></br>The purpose of this study is to try to predict which patients who receive radiotherapy are more likely to have</br>side effects than others. Approximately half of all cancer patients receive radiotherapy as part of their</br>cancer treatment. The dose of radiation given, however, is limited because of a risk of damaging the</br>healthy cells that surround the tumour. Patients vary in how they react to radiation. About 5% of patients (5</br>out of every 100) are sensitive and at risk of having side effects.</br></br>In recent years, researchers have developed predictive models and biological tests to try to identify before</br>the start of treatment those patients who are very sensitive. However, these methods are not yet ready to</br>use in the clinic so radiation doses for all patients are currently limited by the doses the most sensitive</br>patients can have.</br></br>The observational study MICRO-LEARNER addresses the issue of individual sensitivity to radiation with an</br>innovative approach. In particular, we propose to study the composition of the gut and salivary microbiome</br>at the individual level. The microbiome is the population of microorganisms that live in balance within our</br>organism. There are some studies that show that these microorganisms are important in determining the</br>individual sensitivity to radiation. The main purpose of MICRO-LEARNER is to determine whether there is</br>an association between the type of microbiome of single individual and his/her probability of exhibiting side</br>effects of radiotherapy.</br></br>We hope that results from this study will improve current predictive models and biological tests to predict</br>how a patient will respond to radiotherapy. If we are successful, then in future we could identify the</br>'radiosensitive' patients before they start their radiotherapy</br></br>In the long term, our ultimate hypothesis is that information on the individual microbiome before</br>radiotherapy could allow a modification of the microbiome itself in particularly susceptible patients, thus</br>reaching an advantage for future patients. Sensitive patients could potentially be safely and effectively</br>treated after modification of their microbiome, and other patients could be treated with more radiation. This</br>should reduce side effects for all patients, improve quality of life and potentially increase the number of</br>patients successfully treated for their cancer.</br></br>Why have | been chosen?</br></br>You are invited to take part in this study because you were recently diagnosed with prostate or head-and-</br>neck cancer and your doctor has recommended that you should receive radiotherapy. The MICRO-</br>LEARNER study needs 400 patients in total to take part. All patients will be enrolled at the Fondazione</br>IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milan</br>page no 2</br>&gt;---PAGEBREAK---&gt;</br>Do | have to take part?</br></br>No, it is entirely voluntary. If you decide to take part, please keep this information sheet and sign a consent</br>form to show you agree to participate. We will also ask your permission to tell your family doctor that you</br>are taking part in the study. If you do take part, you can withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. A</br>decision to withdraw, or a decision not to take part, will not affect in any way your treatment or the standard</br>of care you receive now or in the future.</br></br>What will happen to me if | do take part?</br></br>If you decide to take part in this study, you will be seen by a member of the research team at the beginning</br>of your radiotherapy treatment who will then ask you to complete some questionnaires asking about</br>symptoms you may be experiencing before you start your radiotherapy treatment and about your general</br>well-being. You will then be asked to complete the same questionnaires again when your radiotherapy is</br>finished and then at routine follow-up appointments at least twice a year for at least three years after your</br>treatment. This is a practical and reliable way for us to measure and record the effects of your radiotherapy</br>treatment. These questionnaires should preferably be completed in the clinic (but could be done at home)</br>and take no more than 20 minutes to complete each time</br></br>If you are receiving treatment for prostate cancer, we will ask you to collect two fecal samples for the</br>analysis of your gut microbiome. They are to be collected at home using a kit that will be provided by the</br>healthcare staff. One sample will be collected before the radiotherapy and one at the end of the treatment.</br>We will also ask you to provide us with three blood samples, one before the beginning of radiotherapy, one</br>after two weeks of treatment, and one at the end of the radiotherapy. Each time, we would like to take a</br>maximum 20 ml of blood, which is less than three tablespoons and similar to the amount taken for routine</br>blood-testing. Then, you'll be asked to perform a multi-parametric magnetic resonance one year after the</br>end of the radiotherapy treatment. This is a very advanced imaging examination that will allow us to</br>investigate how your tissues have responded to radiotherapy.</br></br>If you are receiving treatment for a head-and-neck cancer, we will ask you to collect two samples of saliva</br>for the analysis of your salivary microbiome using a kit that will be provided by the healthcare staff. One</br>sample will be collected before the radiotherapy and one at the end of the treatment. We will also ask you</br>to provide us with three more saliva samples, one before the beginning of radiotherapy, one after two</br>weeks of treatment and one at the end of the radiotherapy, and a blood sample before treatment. we would</br>like to take a maximum 20 ml of blood, which is less than three tablespoons and similar to the amount</br>taken for routine blood-testing.</br></br> </br></br>If you have an oropharynx cancer, you will also be asked to perform a multiparametric magnetic resonance</br>after two weeks of radiotherapy. This is a very advanced imaging examination that will allow us to</br>investigate how your tissues are responding to radiotherapy.</br></br> </br></br>For all patients</br></br>Apart from the short time involved and the minimal discomfort associated with giving blood and collecting</br>fecal/saliva samples, there should be no pain, distress or inconvenience caused to you by taking part in the</br>MICRO-LEARNER study. Your blood/fecal/saliva sample will be coded using a unique study number so</br>that no one outside the study can identify you from it. All samples will be stored and analyzed locally. The</br>results of these tests will not be fed back to you or your doctor.</br></br>It may be possible to use your blood/saliva samples for other tests in the future. We would like to store your</br>samples for future medical research on this or a related project. With your permission, the side effects</br></br>3</br>page no 3</br>&gt;---PAGEBREAK---&gt;</br>information and imaging scans could also be used anonymously (linked with a unique study identifier) in</br>future studies.

       "Placebo treatments provide a window into the therapeutic encounter. Because they are\n",
       "pharmacologically inert, the effects of placebo treatments on the body are mediated by the patient's\n",
       "mind and brain. Placebo effects are caused by the treatment context, including the supportive care\n",
       "provided during the therapeutic encounter (Kaptchuk, 2002; F. G. Miller &amp; Kaptchuk, 2008; Wager &amp;\n",
       "Atlas, 2015), and can be estimated by comparing placebo and no-treatment control groups. Recent\n",

       "including one from our group (Schafer, Colloca, &amp; Wager, 2015), suggest that a transparently prescribed\n",
       "&quot;open-label&quot; placebo can provide effective pain relief--even though participants know they are\n",
       "receiving an inert treatment. Importantly, the treatment is non-deceptive, and thus can ethically be\n",
       "administered to patients in clinical settings (Blease, Colloca, &amp; Kaptchuk, 2016). Patients believe that\n",
       "open-label placebo treatments are ethical and can be therapeutic (Hull et al., 2013; Ortiz, Chandros Hull,\n",
       "&amp; Colloca, 2016; Tilburt, Emanuel, Kaptchuk, Curlin, &amp; Miller, 2008). By comparing open-label placebo\n",
       "treatment with a no-treatment control group, one can assess the effects of the therapeutic encounter\n",
       "independent of beliefs in the specific treatment itself. This is the goal of the present study.\n",

While the bladder is</br>inflating and deflating, we will ask you to rate how much pain you are in. We also apply several</br>painful pressure stimulations to your thumbnail, to confirm that these stimulations are painful but</br>tolerable for you. We want to confirm this because later in the study we will apply more pressure</br>stimulations to your thumbnail.</br></br>  </br></br>The pressure pain device uses a computer-controlled pressure regulator and E</br>compressed air to push a small soft piston into your thumbnail for a few seconds.</br></br>This feels like someone squeezing your thumbnail. Depicted here is a picture of &gt;&gt;</br></br>a thumb in the device. 1</br></br>We will then ask you to fill out an MRI safety questionnaire.</br></br>At this point, we will be able to determine whether you are eligible to continue in the study. If you are</br>not eligible, we will pay you for your time today.</br></br>If you are eligible, you will complete some questionnaires about your mood and personality on a</br>computer. One of these forms will be on a smartphone application that we will ask you to download on</br>to your phone.</br></br>We will then prepare you for the MRI scan. During fMRI scanning we ask you to complete the</br>following tasks:</br></br>1. Ratings of current back pain. We will inflate the bladder under your back in the scanner, and</br>ask you to rate your back pain every 30 -- 60 seconds.</br></br>2. Pressure and sound pain task. We will apply pressure stimulations to your fingernail of varying</br>intensities, and play unpleasant sounds through earbuds that will be in your ears. These</br>stimulations will be mildly to moderately painful or unpleasant but tolerable. Before each</br>stimulation, we will also tell you how other people rated the stimulation. After each</br>stimulation, we'll ask how painful it was for you.</br></br>Then you will be asked to complete a task in which you can earn small amounts of money (~$1-$3) for</br>a number of button presses.</br></br>A blood sample will also be collected at this session. The blood sample will be collected with standard</br>venipuncture (blood draw) technique of an upper extremity vein. You will have 8 ml of blood taken</br>one time, which is about the amount of blood in 1 %2 teaspoons. If there is a contraindication to the</br>blood draw, we will collect a blood spot instead. The blood spot uses a finger stick collection device.</br>The device draws 2 -3 drops of blood from the fingertip, is mildly painful, and has minimal associated</br>risks.</br></br>IRB Document Revision Date: April 8, 2013</br>page no 2</br>&gt;---PAGEBREAK---&gt;</br>Permission to Take Part in a Human Research Study Page 3 of 5</br></br>What happens if I do not want to be in this research?</br>You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you.</br></br>What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?</br></br>You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. We will still use the data we</br>have collected so far, unless you explicitly withdraw your consent in writing. However, it may not be</br>possible to delete all your data because we de-identify them and may not be able to link you to all the</br>data we have collected from you.</br></br>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</br></br>The pressure stimulations: The pressure stimulations will cause you some physical discomfort, though</br>the pain will always be kept within limits that are tolerable to you. Additionally, because some people</br>respond differently to pressure, there is a slight risk of lingering tenderness or discomfort on the thumb.</br>In addition, risks could also result from a malfunction of the pressure equipment used in this study.</br>However, the probability of a machinery malfunction is extremely low: we extensively tested the</br>equipment and carefully monitor it regularly to ensure its proper functioning. If at any point during the</br>experiment the pressure is intolerable, please remove your thumb from the device immediately and alert</br>the experimenter. If you experience severe tenderness or discomfort at any point during the experiment</br>or after, please contact the experimenter immediately. Tenderness or discomfort normally disappears</br>within 24 hours. In the event of injury, please seek medical attention immediately. Safety guidelines for</br>the design and administration of this study are strictly followed in order to minimize any such risk.</br></br> </br></br>Bladder inflation: The inflating bladder might be uncomfortable or painful but cannot damage your</br>back. It may cause psychological discomfort by temporarily eliciting back pain. There is also the</br>possibility of unforeseen risks with the bladder device, such as some lingering pain, even though the</br>device cannot injure the back.</br></br>Blood sample: The risks of taking blood include pain, bruising, redness, swelling, or infection at the</br>puncture site, and a rare risk of fainting. The risks will be minimized by using standard protocols for</br>blood sampling, including techniques to minimize the risk of infection/adverse events.</br></br>Data: There is a risk that people outside of the research team will see your research information. We</br>will do all that we can to protect your information, but it cannot be guaranteed.</br></br>MRI risks: MRI studies are among the safest of all non-invasive medical procedures, but certain</br>hazards exist, including:</br></br>1) If a piece of metal, a device made of metal, or an electronic device were on or in your body,</br>especially in the eye, heart, or brain, you could be injured by the magnetic field.</br></br>2) If you were to be pregnant, it is possible that this protocol could injure the fetus (there is no</br>good data to predict a percentage), but many pregnant women have been safely studied with</br>MRI without injury to the fetus. However, you will be screened prior to the procedure and</br>specifically asked whether you could be pregnant. You will only be studied if you record &quot;No.&quot;</br></br>3) If you were not to wear earplugs, the noise could potentially injure hearing. Earplugs will be</br>offered prior to the examination.</br></br>4) You may have some discomfort due to lying in one position for a long time. The discomfort</br>should subside once the scan is complete, but some participants may be sore for longer.</br></br>IRB Document Revision Date: April 8, 2013</br>page no 3</br>&gt;---PAGEBREAK---&gt;</br>Permission to Take Part in a Human Research Study Page 4 of 5</br></br>5) At sufficient exposure levels, peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is perceptible as &quot;tingling&quot;</br>or &quot;tapping&quot; sensations. PNS symptoms will usually subside shortly after the scan is</br>completed.</br></br>6) You may experience nervousness and/or feelings of claustrophobia. You will be screened for</br>claustrophobia prior to entering the scanner, but should you feel any psychological discomfort</br>upon entering the scanner, you will be able to communicate with the MRI technician and you</br>may stop the scan at any time.</br></br>What are the possible benefits of the study?</br></br>You may not benefit directly by participating in this study. This study is designed for the researcher to</br>learn more about the neurobiology of back pain and the effectiveness of back pain treatments. This</br>study may contribute to developing better treatments for chronic back pain, and could influence how</br>back pain is conceptualized and treated by the medical community.</br></br>Will being in this study help me in any way?</br></br>We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research.</br></br>What happens to the information collected for the research?</br></br>Only the research team will have access to your personal information collected during this study. We</br>cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include</br>the IRB and other representatives of this organization.</br></br>The investigator (or staff acting on behalf of the investigator) will use your information for the</br>research outlined in this consent form.
